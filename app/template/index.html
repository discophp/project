<div class='row'>

    <h1>Strap up those rollerblades and prepare to boogie, the <i>Disco</i> is in full effect!</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <p>This is your index, and the content is coming from <i>`app/template/index.html`</i></p>
    
    <p>Your seeing this because the route <i>`/`</i> has been resolved to the root controller <i>`App\controller\Root`</i> and the function
    <i>`getIndex()`</i> was called and returned this template.</p>
    
    <p>The view is by default using the template <i>`app/template_default.html`</i> to format pages and their <i>Header, Body, and Footer</i>
    the default template is extending the <i>`app/template/_layout.html`</i> which provides the generic HTML structure and resource handling.</p>

    <p>You will notice that the footer stays at the bottom, this is done by the `App.flex()` method in `public/js/js.js` feel free to do with it what as you will.</p>
